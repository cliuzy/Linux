# System Monitoring & Performance Analysis.
### In this section, we will:
Identify the top resource-consuming processes and determine if they are necessary.

Check disk usage to ensure logs are not consuming too much space.

Monitor real-time system logs to detect anomalies
___
#### Identify Resource-Consuming Processes
During peak hours, high CPU or memory usage could slow down the server. We will use the **_top_** and **_ps_** commands to investigate.
```bash
top
```
![sc1](https://files.fm/f/4pjqj3wynt)

Key things to look for in top output:

%CPU column: Shows which processes are using the most CPU.

%MEM column: Displays memory usage per process.

PID: The Process ID needed to investigate or terminate a process.

If a process is consuming high CPU investigate further.

#### use ps to view sorted list
```bash
ps
```
![sc2](https://files.fm/f/t6nvt7jz46)
#### kill the process
```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

___

#### 2. Check Disk Usage (Investigate Log Size)
If logs are too large, they could be slowing down the server.

 Check Overall Disk Usage
 ```bash
 df -h
 ```

![sc3](https://files.fm/f/snv5rebxvp)
check which directories are taking up space
```bash
du -sh /var/log/*
```
![sc4](https://files.fm/f/ubppz3vctk)

#### Clear or Compress Large Log Files

Truncate large log files (without deleting them)

```bash
sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/syslog
```
___

#### 3Ô∏è. Monitor Real-Time System Logs


View Live Logs Using tail
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```
 Identified high CPU/memory-consuming processes and managed them.

Checked disk usage and cleared excessive logs.

 Monitored system logs in real time for anomalies.
